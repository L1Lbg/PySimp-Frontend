        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Proration</h2>
        <p>
          When a subscription is cancelled, it will be prorated.
          <br />
          Proration refers to calculating and charging a user for a proportional amount of a billing cycle based on the number of days the service was used. This ensures the user pays only for the portion of the cycle they utilized, rather than the full period.
          <br />
          <br />
          <u>Example:</u>
          <br />
          Imagine a subscription service costs $30 per month and runs on a 30-day billing cycle. If a user cancels their subscription 15 days into the cycle, they will still be charged for the 15 days they used the service.
          <br />
          To calculate the prorated amount:
          <br />
          Daily cost = $30 รท 30 days = $1 per day
          <br />
          Days of usage = 15 days
          <br />
          Prorated charge = $1 ร 15 days = $15
          <br />
          The user would be charged $15 for the partial billing cycle instead of the full $30.
